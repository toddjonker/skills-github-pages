title: The Ion Fusion programming language
---

**Ion Fusion** is a programmable programming language for working with JSON and [Amazon Ion][ion]
data. Its goal is to simplify data processing by eliminating impedance mismatch and enabling
domain-specific custom syntax. Among its interesting characteristics:

* Fusion source code is Ion data, and the Fusion type system is a superset of the
  [Ion data model][data]. This reduces glue code such as object binding, and eliminates lossy type
  conversions.
* While Fusion facilitates general-purpose use, you can use syntactic abstractions to create custom
  syntax forms and Domain-Specific Languages, even those that are not as general as the core.

Linguistically, Fusion is a dialect of [Racket][], adapted to the Ion notation. Here's a quick 
sample:

```
(for [(value (in_port))]                 // Read each Ion value from stdin into local var `value`
  (writeln (. value "marketplace_id")))  //   and write its marketplace_id field to stdout
```

Fusion has an interactive command console for experimentation, and a "batch" mode for running
scripts and pipelining data. It can also be embedded into Java applications and services, with
some support for sandboxing untrusted code.

Ion Fusion started inside Amazon in 2012, and has been used in production for over a
decade, driving numerous data processing, workflow management, and analytics systems.
It is now an independent Apache-licensed project led by current and former Amazonians.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is under active development, preparing for a 1.0 open source release. The language
> itself is largely stable, but expect significant changes to Java APIs and packaging as we
> renovate everything for public development and use.


# Getting Started

To learn more about this project, browse our documentation at <https://docs.ion-fusion.dev>.

To try out the Fusion CLI, you'll need to build from source (sorry!).  
See [Building Ion Fusion](https://docs.ion-fusion.dev/howto_build.html) for instructions and 
some introductory tutorials.
